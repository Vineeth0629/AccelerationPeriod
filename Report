1.What is .NET?
Ans: It is a product of Microsoft launched in the year 2002, which can be used for building various kinds of Applications like: Web, Mobile, Desktop, Micro services, Cloud, Machine Learning, Game Development and IoT.

2.How to develop all the above applications by using .NET?
Ans: To develop the above applications, .NET provides with a set of Programming Languages, Technologies & Servers using which we can build any kind of Application.

4. What are the Programming Languages, .NET provides to us?
Ans: In .NET there are 30+ programming languages available for a developer to build applications and programmers have a chance of choosing any 1 language from the list.

5. Features of .NET: there are 2 important features in .NET, those are:
     1.Language independent

     2.Platform independent

  1) Language Independent: .NET is a collection of programming Languages i.e.; it provides us multiple languages for building our applications and developers can choose any 1 language from the list to build their applications.

*Most of these languages are extension to some existing languages, like:

C, CPP		=>	C#
Cobol		      =>	Cobol.NET
Pascal		=>	Pascal.NET
Fortran		=>	Fortran.NET
Visual Basic	=>	VB.NET
Python		=>	Python.NET (Iron Python)
Java		      =>	J#.NET

* most popular of all these languages is “C#”
*C# Source Code => Compiled by using C# Compiler => CIL Code

   2.Platform independent: it is an approach of executing an application that is developed on 1 platform


6.What is .NET Framework used for?
Ans: .NET Framework is used to create and run software applications.


*Libraries: A library is a set of re-usable functionalities, and every programming language has built-in libraries to it like Header Files in C & CPP Languages
*Execution Engine: as discussed earlier, .NET Applications will not run under the OS, but they will be running under the Runtime 
*CLR and Core CLR are known as the execution engine of .NET Runtime
*Security Engine: this is responsible for the security of our applications
*JIT Compiler:The compiler which is responsible for converting CIL Code into Machine Code
*Garbage Collector: it is responsible for “Automatic Memory Management” where “Memory Management” is a process of allocation and de-allocation of memory

*.NET Framework: it is the original implementation of .NET and it supports running websites, services, desktop apps, and more on Windows.

*.NET Core: it is a cross-platform implementation for running websites, services, and console apps on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

*.NET Core SDK (Software Development Kit) includes everything you need to build and run .NET Core applications using command line tools or any editor like Visual Studio. 

Github:

*GitHub is a code hosting platform for collaboration and version control. It is a repository (usually abbreviated to “repo”) is a location where all the files for a particular project are stored which lets you (and others) work together on projects.
